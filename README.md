# CS Portfolio Submission

## Overview
This repository includes two projects demonstrating algorithm analysis, sorting techniques, and memory optimization.

---

## Project One: Run-Time and Memory Analysis

### **Objective**:
To analyze the performance of data structures in managing large course datasets, focusing on:
- **Run-Time Complexity**: O(n * m)  
- **Memory Usage**: O(n * (s1 + s2 + m * s3))  

### **Key Features**:
- File validation and processing.
- Vector-based data storage for efficiency.
- Search and retrieval algorithms for course data.

### **Files Included**:
- `runtime_memory_analysis.pdf`: Full analysis of time and space complexity.

## Project Two: Sorting Program

### **Objective**:
Implement sorting algorithms for organizing and retrieving course information.

### **Key Features**:
- Modular and optimized code.
- Sorting functionality for improved data management.
- Real-world applications for file-based course data.
