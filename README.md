# Project One: Run-Time and Memory Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **run-time complexity** and **memory usage** of the data structures used in managing course data. The analysis focuses on:
- File processing and validation
- Data storage using vectors
- Searching and retrieving course information

## Key Highlights
- **Run-Time Complexity**: O(n * m)  
  - `n`: Number of courses  
  - `m`: Average number of prerequisites per course  
- **Memory Usage**: O(n * (s1 + s2 + m * s3))  
  - `s1`: Length of course numbers  
  - `s2`: Length of course titles  
  - `s3`: Average length of prerequisites  

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of commonly used data structures, such as vectors and strings, while implementing efficient algorithms for data management.

## Files Included
- `runtime_memory_analysis.pdf`: A detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the data structures.

## Reflection
Working on this project helped me:
- Understand the importance of choosing the right data structures for efficiency.
- Analyze the trade-offs between time complexity and memory usage.
- Improve my ability to write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
