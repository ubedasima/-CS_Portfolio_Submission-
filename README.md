Overview
This repository contains two key projects that showcase my skills in data structures and algorithms. These projects highlight my ability to analyze the performance of data structures and implement efficient programs to solve practical problems.

Project One: Run-Time and Memory Analysis
Objective:
Analyze the run-time and memory usage of various data structures to understand their performance and trade-offs.

Artifact:
runtime_memory_analysis.docx

Description:
In this project, I evaluated the performance of different data structures, including arrays, linked lists, and vectors, under various operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching. I analyzed their time complexities and memory usage to determine the most efficient structure for specific use cases.

Project Two: Course Sorting Program
Objective:
Implement a program to sort and display a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

Artifact:
course_sorting.cpp

Description:
This program reads a list of Computer Science course names and uses a sorting algorithm to organize them in ascending alphanumeric order. The program ensures efficient sorting and provides clean, readable output.

Reflection
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Project One: The goal was to analyze and compare the run-time and memory efficiency of various data structures.
Project Two: The problem was to develop a program that sorts a list of course names in alphanumeric order using an appropriate sorting algorithm.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached both problems systematically:

In Project One, I started by understanding how each data structure operates and then measured its efficiency during key operations. This helped me realize how choosing the wrong data structure can negatively impact performance.
In Project Two, I implemented a sorting algorithm that efficiently organized the course names. Understanding data structures was critical because it allowed me to choose the best way to handle and manipulate the list of courses.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
In Project One, I encountered challenges understanding the theoretical differences between data structures. To overcome this, I revisited class materials, performed independent research, and wrote small test programs to compare performance.
In Project Two, my initial sorting logic did not produce the correct order for certain edge cases. I fixed this by debugging incrementally and testing my program with various sample inputs.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects expanded my ability to analyze problems and design efficient solutions. I now consider the trade-offs between time complexity and memory usage when choosing data structures. Additionally, I have developed a habit of breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks to simplify implementation.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Through these projects, I learned the importance of:

Modular Design: Writing functions for specific tasks made my code cleaner and easier to debug.
Code Documentation: Adding clear comments and meaningful variable names improved the readability of my programs.
Adaptability: Designing the code with flexibility in mind ensures it can be easily modified or extended in the future.
